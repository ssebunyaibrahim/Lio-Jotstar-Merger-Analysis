## Data Structure and Initial Checks

<details>
<summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

### Data Import

The first step was to import the raw data tables from MySQL databases into Power Query for initial processing. The following tables were imported:

#### LioCinema Database
- `contents`: Captures content details such as type, language, genre, and runtime.
- `subscribers`: Contains demographic and subscription information, including age group, city tier, subscription plans, and activity dates.
- `content_consumption`: Tracks user-level consumption metrics like device type and total watch time.

#### Jotstar Database:
- `contents`: Similar structure to LioCinema’s `contents` table but specific to Jotstar’s library.
- `subscribers`: Captures subscriber demographics, subscription plans, and activity patterns for Jotstar users.
- `content_consumption`: Tracks Jotstar-specific user engagement metrics.

### Data Consolidation

To enable comparative analysis between the two platforms, the following consolidation steps were performed:
- A new column, `platform`, was added to each table to distinguish between LioCinema and Jotstar data.
- The `subscribers` tables from both databases were appended together to create a unified view of all users.
- The `contents` tables were appended to combine the content libraries of both platforms.
- The `content_consumption` tables were merged to analyze watch time and device usage trends collectively.

### Dimension Table Creation

To support the analysis and improve the data model’s efficiency, several dimension tables were created:
- **Platform Dimension Table:** A table listing the two platforms (`LioCinema` and `Jotstar`) was created to serve as a reference for filtering and grouping data by platform.
- **Subscription Dates Dimension Table:** A calendar table was generated to map subscription dates.
- **Plan Change Dates Dimension Table:** Another calendar table was created specifically for `plan_change_date` to track upgrades, downgrades, and their timing across both platforms.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

Several transformations were applied in Power Query to ensure data consistency and usability:
- **Date Formatting:** All date columns were standardized to the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **Null Handling:** Null values in `last_active_date` were retained as-is to indicate active users.
- **Unit Standardization:** Watch time was converted from minutes to hours for easier interpretation during analysis.

### Loading into Power BI

After completing the data preparation in Power Query, the cleaned and transformed datasets were loaded into **Power BI**. Relationships were established between fact tables and dimension tables to create a robust star schema.
