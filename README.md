LioCinema had a massive Gen Z user base, with 91.23% of users aged 18-24—10x higher than Jotstar's 8.77% in the same age bracket. This suggests LioCinema is particularly popular among younger audiences. Jotstar, in contrast, had a stronger presence among the 25-44 age group. While LioCinema still led in these segments.

LioCinema’s largest user segment was from Tier 3 cities while Jotstar’s biggest audience was from Tier 1 cities (38.29% of tier 1 users).

Jotstar offered a VIP plan (19,157 users) while LioCinema did not, and LioCinema’s Basic plan (53,362 users) was also absent on Jotstar.
Jotstar’s library includes 2,360 titles, with a strong focus on English (49.40%) and sports (19.66%). LioCinema has 1,250 titles, emphasizing Hindi (31.68%) and regional languages like Telugu (18.60%) and Tamil (16.84%).

User engagement metrics revealed Jotstar's edge, with 85.09% of its users being active compared to LioCinema’s 55.13%, and a notably higher average watch time of 117.24 hrs. against LioCinema’s 25.61 hrs.

Users with higher watch times are less likely to become inactive (e.g., Jotstar’s active users watch 132.03 hours vs. 32.85 hours for inactive users). 

LioCinema faced a higher downgrade rate at 83.39% versus Jotstar's 38.67%, suggesting potential issues with LioCinema's premium offerings. Conversely Jotstar's paid user base constituted 70.99% of total users compared to LioCinema's 34.61%, reflecting a more effective monetization strategy.

LioCinema relied heavily on Free → Basic upgrades (8.31%), Jotstar saw stronger movement toward premium (9.63% Free → Premium, 39.79% VIP → Premium), whereas LioCinema struggled with higher-tier upgrades.

Jotstar generated a total revenue of ₹ 47M significantly higher than LioCinema’s ₹18M with January being Jotstar’s best-performing month at ₹ 7,712,796. Both platforms experienced Q4 declines: LioCinema dropped 19.64% in November, and Jotstar fell 49.37%.

To ensure merger success, it was recommended to expand LioCinema’s content library with regional and English-language offerings, introduce a mid-tier VIP plan to reduce downgrades and encourage upgrades, adopt Jotstar’s personalized engagement strategies to improve user retention, tailor regional pricing and content strategies for Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, and optimize watch time by leveraging Jotstar’s successful content drivers like long-form content and AI-driven recommendations. These actions aim to enhance content diversity, boost monetization, and stabilize revenue post-merger.

## **Data Structure and Initial Checks**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

### **Data Import**

The first step was to import the raw data tables from MySQL databases into Power Query for initial processing. The following tables were imported:

#### LioCinema Database
- `contents`: Captures content details such as type, language, genre, and runtime.
- `subscribers`: Contains demographic and subscription information, including age group, city tier, subscription plans, and activity dates.
- `content_consumption`: Tracks user-level consumption metrics like device type and total watch time.

#### Jotstar Database:
- `contents`: Similar structure to LioCinema’s `contents` table but specific to Jotstar’s library.
- `subscribers`: Captures subscriber demographics, subscription plans, and activity patterns for Jotstar users.
- `content_consumption`: Tracks Jotstar-specific user engagement metrics.

     style="width: auto; height: auto; display: block; margin: 40px auto;"/>

### **Data Consolidation**

To enable comparative analysis between the two platforms, the following consolidation steps were performed:

A new column, `platform`, was added to each table to distinguish between LioCinema and Jotstar data. This ensured that platform-specific insights could still be extracted after appending.

The `subscribers` tables from both databases were appended together to create a unified view of all users across LioCinema and Jotstar. 

This allowed for seamless analysis of demographic trends, subscription patterns, and activity metrics across platforms.

Similarly, the `contents` tables were appended to combine the content libraries of both platforms, enabling insights into content diversity, language preferences, and genre popularity.

The `content_consumption` tables were also merged to analyze watch time and device usage trends for both platforms collectively.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssebunyaibrahim/Lio-Jotstar-Merger-Analysis/refs/heads/main/Images/Power%20Query.png"
     style="width: auto; height: auto; display: block; margin: 40px auto;"/>

### **Dimension Table Creation**

To support the analysis and improve the data model’s efficiency, several dimension tables were created:
- **Platform Dimension Table:** A table listing the two platforms (`LioCinema` and `Jotstar`) was created to serve as a reference for filtering and grouping data by platform.
- **Subscription Dates Dimension Table:** A calendar table was generated to map subscription dates.
- **Plan Change Dates Dimension Table:** Another calendar table was created specifically for `plan_change_date` to track upgrades, downgrades, and their timing across both platforms.

### **Data Cleaning and Transformation**

Several transformations were applied in Power Query to ensure data consistency and usability:
- **Date Formatting:** All date columns were standardized to the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **Null Handling:** Null values in `last_active_date` were retained as-is to indicate active users.
- **Unit Standardization:** Watch time was converted from minutes to hours for easier interpretation during analysis.

### **Loading into Power BI**

After completing the data preparation in Power Query, the cleaned and transformed datasets were loaded into **Power BI**. Relationships were established between fact tables and dimension tables to create a robust star schema.The ER Diagram can be presented below.

     style="width: auto; height: auto; display: block; margin: 40px auto;"/>

Custom measures were then created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate key metrics, and then visualizations were created to explore trends, compare platforms, and derive actionable insights.

## **Recommendations**
To ensure a successful merger and the establishment of Lio-Jotstar as the leading OTT platform in India, the following strategic recommendations are proposed.
### **Leverage Jotstar’s Premium Content to Convert LioCinema’s Free Users**
To maximize monetization post-merger, the combined platform should prioritize converting LioCinema’s large base of Free users (43.05% active) into paying customers by leveraging Jotstar’s premium content library. For instance, offering exclusive access to Jotstar’s high-demand English and sports content (e.g., 800 English titles and 354 sports titles) through targeted promotions or free trials can incentivize upgrades. This strategy directly addresses LioCinema’s heavy reliance on Free-tier users (90.26%) and aligns with Jotstar’s success in driving paid subscriptions (70.99% paid users).

### **Introduce a Mid-Tier VIP Plan to Reduce Downgrades**
LioCinema faces a significantly higher downgrade rate (83.39%) compared to Jotstar (38.67%), indicating dissatisfaction with its premium offerings. To address this, the merged platform should introduce a mid-tier VIP plan, similar to Jotstar’s, which offers exclusive previews, ad-free experiences, and bundled benefits. This intermediate upgrade path can reduce downgrades and encourage smoother transitions from Free to Premium plans, as evidenced by Jotstar’s strong VIP → Premium transition rate (39.79%)

### **Optimize Content Recommendations to Increase Watch Time**
LioCinema’s average watch time (25.61 hours) lags far behind Jotstar’s (117.24 hours), highlighting an opportunity to improve engagement. Post-merger, the platform should adopt Jotstar’s AI-driven recommendation algorithms and personalized content strategies to optimize user experience. For example, promoting binge-worthy series and long-form content that aligns with user preferences can help close the gap and drive higher engagement, particularly among Tier 3 users who currently watch only 18 hours on average.

### **Tailor Regional Strategies to Boost Tier 2 and Tier 3 Engagement**
LioCinema dominates Tier 3 cities (91.19% of its user base) but struggles with low engagement and paid adoption in these regions. Post-merger, the platform should introduce localized pricing, regional-language content (e.g., Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi), and culturally relevant promotions to attract and retain Tier 2 and Tier 3 users. For instance, replicating Jotstar’s success in Tier 1 cities (70.99% paid users) by offering affordable subscription tiers in Tier 3 cities could significantly boost revenue and engagement.

### **Address Seasonal Revenue Declines with Targeted Campaigns**
Both platforms experienced sharp revenue declines in Q4—LioCinema dropped 19.64% in November, and Jotstar fell 49.37% in December. To stabilize revenue post-merger, the combined platform should launch end-of-year campaigns featuring exclusive content releases, holiday-themed promotions, or loyalty rewards. For example, introducing a “Year-End Binge Pass” with discounted access to blockbuster movies or sports events could mitigate seasonal churn and drive sustained revenue growth.
